##### STEP 1: SET ABILITY SCORES

Choose a score in the left column and note its cost in the right column.
Do this six times to generate six scores.
The total costs you note in this way cannot exceed 27.

	Score	Cost
	08	0
	09	1
	10	2
	11	3
	12	4
	13	5
	14	7
	15	9

Assign the six scores you generated to the six ability scores in any order (see character-sheet.md).

##### STEP 2: CHOOSE RACE

Determine your initial number of experience tokens. This number is 5 unless the GM says otherwise.
Choose any race with an Intelligence of -2 or greater whose level is less than your number of experience tokens.

Spend a number from your experience tokens equal to that race's level.
Modify your ability scores by adding that race's ability scores to yours.
You gain that race's features.

##### STEP 3: CHOOSE AGE CATEGORY

Consult your race's age category table.
For each entry in the table that contains a die roll, roll the dice and add any noted flat value.
The results are the personalized age category transition ages for your character.
You advance out of an age category upon becoming that category's indicated age.
You or the GM may also request that the GM perform these age cutoff rolls in secret.

Choose an age, then consult your character's personalized age category table to determine your age category.
Apply the penalties for that age category to your ability scores.
Apply the bonuses for that age category to your ability scores.

##### STEP 4: CHOOSE BACKGROUNDS

You will have at least one remaining experience token at this time.
You must spend an experience token and choose a background.
If your age category does not allow a background, you forfeit the experience token (without spending it).
You may choose again if you have experience tokens remaining and your age category allows more backgrounds.

You gain the equipment and features of all backgrounds you chose.

##### STEP 5: SPEND LEVELS

If you have remaining experience tokens, spend them as outlined in character-advancement.md, skipping training time.
