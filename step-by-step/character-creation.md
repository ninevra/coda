	STEP 1: SET ABILITY SCORES

Choose a score in the left column and note its cost in the right column.
Do this six times to generate six scores.
The total costs you note in this way cannot exceed 27.

	Score	Cost
	08	0
	09	1
	10	2
	11	3
	12	4
	13	5
	14	7
	15	9

Assign the six scores you generated to the six ability scores in any order.

	STEP 2: CHOOSE RACE

Determine your starting level budget.
If the GM has not set a level budget, your level budget is 5.
Choose any race with an Intelligence of -2 or greater, whose level is less than your level budget.

Reduce your remaining level budget by that race's level.
Modify your ability scores by adding that race's ability scores to yours.
You gain that race's features.

	STEP 3: CHOOSE AGE CATEGORY

Consult your race's age category table.
For each entry in the table that contains a die roll, roll the dice and add any noted flat value.
These numbers are the personalized age category transition ages for your character.
You or the GM may also request that the GM perform these age cutoff rolls in secret.

Choose an age, then consult your character's personalized age category table to determine your age category.
Apply the penalties for that age category to your ability scores.
Apply the bonuses for that age category to your ability scores.

	STEP 4: CHOOSE BACKGROUNDS

Choose a number of character backgrounds no greater than your remaining level budget or the number of backgrounds in your age category's bonus column.

Subtract one from your remaining level budget for each background chosen.
You gain the equipment and features of those backgrounds.

	STEP 5: SPEND LEVELS

If your remaining level budget is above zero, spend these levels as outlined in character-advancement.md.
