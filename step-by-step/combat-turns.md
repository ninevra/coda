	COMBAT

A combat is begun when two sides are both aware that one side has taken a hostile action.
The hostile action that began the combat is resolved before the combat begins.

Examples of hostile actions that start a combat include detecting the presence of a creature you regard as an enemy, drawing a weapon, or attacking a creature.
Multiple such hostile actions may occur simultaneously.
For example, a team of ambushing archers could fire a volley, a party of player characters could draw their weapons together, or two hostile warbands could see each other at the same time.

In order to resolve an attack before a combat begins, the attack itself must be the first hostile action of which both parties are aware.
This can be achieved by attacking from an unseen position (making a Dexterity check to hide, opposed by the victim's passive Wisdom), by attacking with a concealed weapon (making a Dexterity check to conceal an item, opposed by the victim's passive Wisdom), by attacking a creature that assumed you to be friendly (making a Charisma check to conceal your intent, opposed by the victim's passive Wisdom), or by other means.

Attacks resolved outside of combat roll with advantage.

	SURPRISE

When combat begins, participants who did not resolve a hostile action before the beginning of combat are surprised.
Traditionally, these creatures are those who were unaware combat was about to begin, and thus did not draw weapons.

Surprised is a condition. It does not grant advantage to attackers or deny Dexterity bonuses.
Surprised combatants cease to be surprised at the end of the round.
Surprised combatants cannot take reactions.
Surprised combatants receive one action point on their turn instead of any greater number.

	INITIATIVE

When combat begins, all participants make a Dexterity check.
This check is called "initiative" and some effects may refer to it specifically.

The check result of each participant is recorded in descending order.
Ties are resolved by checking the constant component (the number before the die roll), then by checking Dexterity modifiers, then by random result.

If a new participant joins in an ongoing combat, the new participant's initiative is set to 0, and they lose all ties.
If multiple new participants join an ongoing combat simultaneously, they make initiative checks to tiebreak among themselves.
After these initiative checks, the new participants are added to the combat at initiative 0, in the correct order.
	
	ROUNDS

Beginning with the creature with the highest initiative and descending the list, each creature gets a turn.
When all creatures have had their turn, the round ends.

After the round ends, effects which end "at the end of the round" all end simultaneously.

Effects which occur "at then end of the round" happen next.
The effects occur in the order that their controllers would act.
If a combatant created more than one such effect, they choose the order.
Effects not created by any combatant act last.
Effects which occur "every round" happen next.

	TURNS

At the beginning of each creature's turn, that creature is awarded action points.
The default number of action points is 3, but effects can add to, subtract from, or replace that number.

Effects which persist "until your next turn" end at this time.
Effects which trigger on your "next turn" trigger next.
Effects which trigger "every turn" trigger next.

You may take an action, paying its action point cost.
Repeat this as many times as you like, as long as you have action points remaining.
You cannot spend action points into the negatives.

When you have no more action points or no longer wish to take actions, your turn ends.

Effects which persist "until end of turn" end at this time.
Effects which trigger "at the end of your turn" trigger next.

	ACTIONS

When you spend action points on an action, you must complete the entire action before starting another action or ending your turn.
In acknowledgement of this, many actions say you "may" do something or must do "up to" a certain amount of something.

If an action instructs you to take other actions, you do not pay action points (or any other cost) for those subsidiary actions.

	REACTIONS

Every turn, you receive a reaction point.
This reaction point persists until spent or until replaced with a new reaction point.
You cannot have more than one reaction point at a time.

A reaction is a specialized kind of action that you pay for with reaction points instead of action points.
Additionally, you cannot take a reaction unless prompted by a "trigger condition."

Whenever an action is taken near you or your environment changes, a trigger condition may be met for a reaction you can take.
One example of a reaction is the Land Softly reaction, which is triggered when you fall.
When the trigger comes up, you may spend your reaction point to take the triggered reaction, or you may decline.
If multiple reactions are triggered simultaneously, you go through all of them in the order of your choice and either take them or decline them.
You cannot take a reaction if you have no remaining reaction points.
You spend your reaction point when you take a reaction.

	FREE ACTIONS

Like a reaction, a free action is an action you can only take when a trigger condition is met.
However, free actions cost no resource to take.
The only restriction is that you can only take one free action any time a trigger condition is met.
If multiple free actions are triggered by the same change in environment, you may only choose one and must decline the rest.
