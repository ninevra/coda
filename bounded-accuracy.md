The cap on an ability score through normal progression is 20 (mod 5).
The cap on a magically augmented ability score is 22 (mod 6), but this will be disregarded.

The lowest tier of skill, aptitude, grants +1 or +2.
The middle tier of skill, proficiency, is worth +2 or +3.
The final tier of skill, mastery, grants +4.

Item enhancement bonuses never exceed +3 and are most commonly +1.
Temporary magical enhancements to skills are added with item enhancement bonuses and the total is capped at +3.

Thus, the highest attainable roll to hit is 5 ability, 4 skill, and 3 magic, totalling 1d20+12.
In contrast, first-level characters will probably have 3 ability, 1 skill, and 0 magic, totalling 1d20+4.
Attacking at anything less than +4 is considered an artifact of poor character building.
These assumptions result in an 8-point difference between top-tier characters and new characters.

This 8-point difference should be mirrored in the increase of a character's evasion defense.
A top-tier character should also be hittable by a new character.
The maximum result of 1d20+4 is 24.
This results in a maximum fair evasion defense of 24.

24 - 8 = 16, so we can project that a first-level character should have 16 evasion at most.
16 - 4 = 12, so we project that when two evasion-focused characters face off, attacks will hit evasion on a roll of 12.
There are therefore 11 die results that miss and 9 that hit, for a 45% hit chance in a fair fight.

Of the 24 points of a maximum evasion score, 5 will come from a top-tier dexterity modifier. 24 - 5 = 19.
Of the 19 remaining points, 3 will come from a combination of item enhancement and temporary magic. 18 - 3 = 16.
Of the 16 remaining points, 6 can be provided by equipment under the old Coda equipment system. 16 - 6 = 10.
This leaves 10, which is a traditional amount to use as a flat bonus, offsetting the 1d20.

At level 1, this means that a dexterity-focused character with 0-quality equipment will have 16 evasion.
A level 1 character with 10 dexterity and no equipment will have 10.
16 - 4 = 12 (or 45% hit chance). 10 - 4 = 6 (or 75% hit chance). These figures are desirable.

The same roll to hit will be used against armor and against focus.
However, the cap to these defenses is not 24, as a low-level character can wear these defenses down.
Each time an attack misses against an armor defense, the missed character takes a bruise.
The total number of bruises on a character is subtracted from their armor defense and is uncapped.
This frees the armor defense to be arbitrarily high.
Similarly, the focus defense is reduced on each character by that character's feedback score, an uncapped amount.

Evasion contains a flat 10, a magic bonus (3), an ability bonus (5), and an equipment bonus (6), but no skill bonus.
Old Coda equipment system allowed up to 12 equipment bonus to armor and to focus, compared to the 6 for evasion.
This is 6 points more, or 30% hit chance less (45 - 30 = 15). This figure is considered desirable for playtesting.

All references to the old Coda equipment system thus far have been in exclusion of shield slot items.
The shield item provides its bonus to armor (up to 3) at all times.
It can be raised with a reaction triggered by an attack against evasion, and will grant its bonus against the attack.
The shield is not considered to violate the evasion cap as it can be overcome with sufficient attacks per round.
