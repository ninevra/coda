If a character is said to be able to wear only one item classified as armor, that's either a special property of armor or an implicit introduction of item slots per character.
The item slot solution is more efficient if more than one type of item is unstackable, but it only poorly covers items that occupy more than one slot.

On balance, it appears to be superior design to use item slots, as characters can gain them and lose them dynamically.

A character has the following item slots:

One armor slot.
One outerwear slot.
One weapon slot per arm (usually two).

Items in item slots contribute their weight to your wear weight.
While your wear weight exceeds your maximum wear weight (strength * 3), you are encumbered.

	ARMOR

Only armor items can be put in the armor slot.
All armor items are copies of the Template Armor.

The Template Armor weighs 32 units and provides 6 protection while worn.
As with all items, the Template Armor can have up to four units of workmanship applied.

At the time of the item's creation, its size category must be chosen. It can only be worn by a creature of matching size category.
The following upgrades can be purchased with one unit of workmanship apiece, only at the time of the item's creation:

Light Materials: This armor item weighs 4 units less, to a minimum of 20. It takes 1 minute less to don, to a minimum of 2.
Superior Design: This armor item provides 2 more protection, to a maximum of 12.

The following upgrades can be purchased with one unit of workmanship apiece:

Upgraded Components: This armor item provides 2 more protection, to a maximum of 12.
TODO: More armor traits.

Donning armor takes 5 minutes. Removing it takes 2.
Armor which weighs more than 30 units and provides more than 9 protection requires external aid to don.

You have the option to forego a piece of a set of armor when donning it.
This reduces its weight by 6 and its protection by 2, and enables you to don it without aid if you couldn't already.
If you lose the piece you did not wear, the armor becomes incomplete and thereafter can only be worn incomplete, as above.

	CLOAK

Only outerwear items can be put in the outerwear slot.
All outerwear items are copies of the Template Cloak.

The Template Cloak weighs 4 units and provides 3 evasion while worn.
As with all items, the Template Cloak can have up to four units of workmanship applied.

At the time of the item's creation, its size category must be chosen. It can only be worn by a creature of matching size category.
The following upgrades can be purchased with one unit of workmanship apiee, only at the time of the item's creation:

Light Materials: This cloak weighs 1 unit less, to a minimum of 1.
Superior Design: This cloak provides 1 more evasion, to a maximum of 6.

The following upgrades can be purchased with one unit of workmanship apiece:

Upgraded Components: This cloak provides 1 more evasion, to a maximum of 6.
